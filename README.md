# Propulsion Plants Decay Evaluation...
## The objective of this repository is to process data in propulsion.csv and build an algorithm to:
### • Develop a model, to predict the column
#####    ◦ ‘GT Compressor decay state coefficient’
#####    ◦ GT Turbine decay state coefficient minimizing ‘rmse’ loss function
### • Try out different techniques from ML/DL and share comparative results
### • Use proper feature selection process and hyperparameter tuning (if required)
